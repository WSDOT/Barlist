Creating Bar Groups {#ug_groups}
============
A barlist consists of groups of bars. Groups typically represent elements of a bridge such as Deck, Abutment, Pier. 

Sub-groups, such as Pier 1, Column 2, are not supported because of the flat nature of the barlist sheet in WSDOT bridge plans. However, sub-groups can be simulated by creating groups that do not contain bars. 

To create a group:
1. Select Project > Add Group
2. Enter the group name

Groups can also be created as bars are being defined in the [bar definition dialog](@ref dlg_bars).
