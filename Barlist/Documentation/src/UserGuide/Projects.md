What is a Barlist Project {#ug_projects}
============
Barlist supports two types of projects:

1. Barlist projects are the typical project type and are basically the same as in all previous version of the Barlist program.  
2. Collaboration projects bring together multiple Barlist projects, created by different engineers that are collaborating on a bridge design project, into a single Barlsit.

Both types of barlist projects estimate reinforcing steel quantities.
